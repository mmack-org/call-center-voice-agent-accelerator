|---|---|

Welcome to the *Call Center Real-time Voice Agent* solution accelerator — a lightweight template for building speech-to-speech voice agents powered by **Azure Voice Live API**. It supports multiple telephony providers out of the box, including **Azure Communication Services (ACS)**, **Twilio**, **Infobip**, **Sinch**, **Genesys Cloud (AudioHook)**, and **Bandwidth**, plus a **web browser** client for quick testing. Bring your own telephony provider or use the built-in options. Start locally, deploy to Azure Container Apps.

The Azure voice live API is a solution enabling low-latency, high-quality speech to speech interactions for voice agents. The API is designed for developers seeking scalable and efficient voice-driven experiences as it eliminates the need to manually orchestrate multiple components. By integrating speech recognition, generative AI, and text to speech functionalities into a single, unified interface, it provides an end-to-end solution for creating seamless experiences. Learn more about [Azure Voice Live API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live).

The Azure Communication Services Calls Automation APIs provide telephony integration and real-time event triggers to perform actions based on custom business logic specific to their domain. Within the call automation APIs developers can use simple AI powered APIs, which can be used to play personalized greeting messages, recognize conversational voice inputs to gather information on contextual questions to drive a more self-service model with customers, use sentiment analysis to improve customer service overall. Learn more about [Azure Communication Services (Call Automation)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/call-automation/call-automation).

Alternatively, telephony integration is supported through third-party providers, including [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/media-streams), [Infobip](https://www.infobip.com/docs/voice-and-video/calls), [Sinch](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/voice/), [Genesys Cloud (AudioHook)](https://developer.genesys.cloud/devapps/audiohook), and [Bandwidth](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/voice/).

<br/>

## Features
This sample demonstrates how to build a real-time voice agent using the [Azure Speech Voice Live API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live).

The solution includes:
- A backend service that connects to the **Voice Live API** for real-time ASR, LLM and TTS
- **Multiple client options:** The web browser client is always available. For telephony, choose **one** provider:
  - **Web browser** — microphone/speaker via WebSocket (always available, great for testing)
  - **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** — enterprise PSTN with Call Automation (default)
  - **Twilio** — PSTN via Twilio Media Streams with webhook signature validation
  - **Infobip** — PSTN via Infobip Calls API with WebSocket audio streaming
  - **Genesys Cloud** — AudioHook (Audio Connector) for real-time call audio streaming
  - **Sinch** — PSTN via Sinch Voice connectStream (closed beta) with WebSocket audio streaming
  - **Bandwidth** — PSTN via Bandwidth Programmable Voice with bidirectional media streaming (BXML)

  > **Telephony selection:** Only one telephony provider can be active at a time. The service automatically selects the provider based on the configured credentials. If no credentials are provided, Azure Communication Services is used by default.
- **Ambient Scenes** (optional): Add realistic background audio (office, call center) or use custom audio files to simulate real-world environments
- Flexible configuration to customize prompts, ASR, TTS, and behavior
- Easy extension to other client types

> You can also try the Voice Live API via [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/foundry) for quick experimentation before deploying this template to your own Azure subscription.

<details>
  <summary><b>Deploy in your local environment</b></summary>

 ### Local Environment

If you're not using one of the above options for opening the project, then you'll need to:

1. Make sure the following tools are installed:

    * `bash`
    * [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)

2. Download the project code:

    ```shell
    azd init -t Azure-Samples/call-center-voice-agent-accelerator/
    ```
    **Note:** the above command should be run in a new folder of your choosing. You do not need to run `git clone` to download the project source code. `azd init` handles this for you.

3. Open the project folder in your terminal or editor.
4. Continue with the [deploying steps](#deploying).

</details>
 
### Deploying

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces) or in [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers) or [locally](#local-environment), you can deploy it to Azure following the following steps. 

To change the `azd` parameters from the default values, follow the steps [here](./docs/customizing_azd_parameters.md). 

1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```
    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "voice-agent-dev"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a [Voice Live region](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/regions?tabs=voice-live).

    The setup hook will:
    - **Validate the realtime deployment** — verify the configured model, version, and SKU against the live regional Foundry inventory
    - **Telephony provider selection** — choose ACS (default), Twilio, Infobip, Sinch, Genesys, or Bandwidth
    - **Credential entry** — securely prompts for tokens/keys only if you picked Twilio, Infobip, Sinch, Genesys, or Bandwidth

    After provisioning completes, you'll see a deployment summary with your webhook endpoint(s) and next steps.

3. When `azd` has finished deploying, open the **Application URL** shown in the output to test in your browser. 🎉

4. When you've made any changes to the app code, you can just run:

    ```shell
    azd deploy
    ```

5. To select or upgrade the provisioned model without changing application
   code, follow [Foundry project and realtime model](./docs/foundry-project.md).

6. To view live logs:

    ```shell
    azd monitor --logs
    ```

7. When done, clean up all resources:

    ```shell
    azd down
    ```



>[!NOTE]
>- The template creates a project-enabled Foundry resource, project, secure project connection, and a pinned GPT Realtime deployment. See [Foundry project and realtime model](./docs/foundry-project.md) for defaults, outputs, regional checks, validation, and upgrades.
>- **Not all model versions or SKUs are available in every region or subscription.** The pre-provision hook validates the live Azure inventory; ARM reports quota and capacity failures for the named deployment resource.
>- See [Voice Live supported regions and models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/regions?tabs=voice-live) and [Foundry model region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure) before deployment.
>- Post-Deployment: Webhook configuration is handled automatically by the post-deploy script. For ACS telephony, you'll still need to acquire a PSTN phone number (see [Testing the Agent](#testing-the-agent) below).



## Testing the Agent

After deployment, you can verify that your Voice Agent is running correctly using the **Web Client** (quick browser test) or a **telephony client** for a real-world call center scenario.

### 🌐 Web Client (Test Mode)

Use this browser-based client to confirm your Container App is up and responding.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the **Resource Group** created by your deployment.
2. Find and open the **Container App** resource.
3. On the **Overview** page, copy the **Application URL**.
4. Open the URL in your browser — a demo webpage should load.
5. Click **Start Talking to Agent** to begin a voice session using your browser’s microphone and speaker.
6. Click **Stop Conversation** to end the session.

> ⚠️ This web client is intended for testing purposes only. Use the ACS client below for production-like call flow testing.



### 📞 Telephony with ACS Client (Call Center Scenario)

This simulates a real inbound phone call to your voice agent using **Azure Communication Services (ACS)**.

#### 1. Webhook (Automatic)

The `IncomingCall` Event Grid subscription is **created automatically** by the post-deploy script during `azd up`. No manual portal configuration is needed.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (if needed)</summary>

1. In the same resource group, find and open the **Communication Services** resource.
2. In the left-hand menu, click **Events**.
3. Click **+ Event Subscription** and fill in the following:
   - **Event Type**: `IncomingCall`
   - **Endpoint Type**: `Web Hook`
   - **Endpoint Address**:
     ```
     https://<your-container-app-url>/acs/incomingcall
     ```

📸 Refer to the screenshot below for guidance:

![Event Subscription screenshot](./docs/images/acs_eventsubscription_v0.0.1.png)

</details>

#### 2. Get a Phone Number

If you haven't already, obtain a phone number for your ACS resource:

👉 [How to get a phone number (Microsoft Docs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp-new)


#### 3. Call the Agent

Once the phone number is active:

- Dial the ACS number.
- Your call will connect to the real-time voice agent powered by Azure Voice Live.

### 📞 Telephony with Twilio Client (Call Center Scenario)

Inbound calls are handled via [Twilio Media Streams](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/media-streams) — the server validates the request, connects the caller's audio to the AI agent via a real-time WebSocket, and bridges it to Azure Voice Live.

#### 1. Prerequisites

- A [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
- A phone number purchased in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console)

> During `azd up`, the setup wizard prompts for Twilio credentials and stores the token securely in Azure Key Vault.

| Variable | Description | Where to find it |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Your Twilio Account SID | [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) → Account Info |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Your Twilio Auth Token | [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) → Account Info |

#### 2. Webhook (Automatic)

The Twilio webhook is **configured automatically** by the post-deploy script during `azd up`. It sets your phone number's voice URL to `https://<your-container-app-url>/voice`.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (if needed)</summary>

1. In the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com), go to your phone number's configuration.
2. Under **PhoneNumber → A Call Comes In**, set:
   - **Webhook URL:** `https://<your-container-app-url>/voice`
   - **HTTP Method:** `POST`
3. Save changes.

</details>

#### 3. Call the Agent

Dial your Twilio phone number. The call connects to the real-time voice agent powered by Azure Voice Live.

**How it works:**
1. Twilio sends a request to `/voice` — the server validates it and returns TwiML to start a media stream
2. Twilio opens a WebSocket to `/twilio/ws` — the server verifies the embedded token, then bridges audio to Azure Voice Live
3. The AI agent hears the caller, generates a response, and audio is streamed back through the same connection

### 📞 Telephony with Infobip Client (Call Center Scenario)

Inbound calls are handled via the [Infobip Calls API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/channels/voice/calls) — the server answers the call, then bridges the caller's audio to Azure Voice Live via a WebSocket connection.

#### 1. Prerequisites

- An [Infobip account](https://www.infobip.com/signup) with Voice capabilities enabled
- A phone number purchased in the [Infobip Portal](https://portal.infobip.com)

> During `azd up`, the setup wizard prompts for your Infobip API key and base URL, and stores the key securely in Azure Key Vault.

| Variable | Description | Where to find it |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `INFOBIP_API_KEY` | Your Infobip API key | [Infobip Portal](https://portal.infobip.com) → Homepage → API Key |
| `INFOBIP_API_BASE_URL` | Your account's API base URL (e.g. `https://xxxxx.api.infobip.com`) | [Infobip Portal](https://portal.infobip.com) → Homepage → Base URL |

#### 2. Webhook (Automatic)

All Infobip configuration is **set up automatically** by the post-deploy script during `azd up`:
- Notification profile with webhook URL
- Media stream configuration with WebSocket URL
- Calls configuration
- Event subscription for call lifecycle events

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (if needed)</summary>

1. In the [Infobip Portal](https://portal.infobip.com), go to **Channels and Numbers → VOICE AND WEBRTC**.
2. Under **Notification Profile**, create or update a profile with:
   - **Notify URL:** `https://<your-container-app-url>/infobip/incoming`
3. Under **Calls API → Media streaming**, create a new configuration with:
   - **URL:** `wss://<your-container-app-url>/infobip/ws`
   - **Audio format:** `audio/l16;rate=24000` (PCM 16-bit, 24kHz)
4. Under **Calls API → Calls Configuration**, create a configuration linked to your notification profile and media stream config.
5. Assign your Infobip phone number to this Calls Configuration.
6. Under **Event Subscription** (via API: `POST /subscriptions/1/subscription/VOICE_VIDEO`), create a subscription with events:
   - `CALL_RECEIVED`, `CALL_ESTABLISHED`, `CALL_FINISHED`, `CALL_FAILED`, `CALL_STARTED`, `CALL_DISCONNECTED`
   - `MEDIA_STREAM_STARTED`, `MEDIA_STREAM_FAILED`, `MEDIA_STREAM_FINISHED`
   - `DIALOG_CREATED`, `DIALOG_ESTABLISHED`, `DIALOG_FAILED`, `DIALOG_FINISHED`
   - `DTMF_CAPTURED`, `CALL_RINGING`, `CALL_PRE_ESTABLISHED`

</details>

#### 3. Call the Agent

Dial your Infobip phone number. The call connects to the real-time voice agent powered by Azure Voice Live.

**How it works:**
1. Infobip sends a `CALL_RECEIVED` webhook to `/infobip/incoming` — the server answers the call
2. Once established, the server creates a Dialog that bridges the caller to the WebSocket endpoint
3. Infobip connects to `/infobip/ws` — audio flows bidirectionally between the caller and Azure Voice Live

### 📞 Telephony with Sinch Client (Call Center Scenario)

Inbound calls are handled via the [Sinch Voice API](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/voice/) connectStream feature — on an incoming call the server returns SVAML that instructs Sinch to open a WebSocket, then bridges the caller's audio to Azure Voice Live over that connection.

> **Note:** connectStream is a **closed beta** Sinch feature. You must have it enabled on your Sinch account before it can be used.

#### 1. Prerequisites

- A [Sinch account](https://dashboard.sinch.com/signup) with the Voice API and **connectStream (closed beta)** enabled
- A Voice-enabled phone number assigned to your Sinch Voice application

> During `azd up`, the setup wizard prompts for your Sinch application credentials and stores the secret securely in Azure Key Vault.

| Variable | Description | Where to find it |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `SINCH_APPLICATION_KEY` | Your Sinch Voice application key | [Sinch Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com) → Voice → Apps |
| `SINCH_APPLICATION_SECRET` | Your Sinch Voice application secret | [Sinch Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com) → Voice → Apps |

#### 2. Callback URL (Automatic)

The Sinch callback URL is **configured automatically** by the post-deploy script during `azd up`, using the Sinch [Update Callbacks](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/voice/api-reference/configuration/tag/Callbacks/) API. It points your Voice application at `https://<your-container-app-url>/sinch/callbacks`.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (if needed)</summary>

1. In the [Sinch Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com), open your Voice application settings.
2. Set the **Callback URL (primary)** to `https://<your-container-app-url>/sinch/callbacks`.
3. Ensure **connectStream (closed beta)** is enabled for the application.
4. Assign your Voice-enabled phone number to the application.

</details>

#### 3. Call the Agent

Dial your Sinch phone number. The call connects to the real-time voice agent powered by Azure Voice Live.

**How it works:**
1. Sinch sends an Incoming Call Event (ICE) to `/sinch/callbacks` — the server validates the signature and returns SVAML with a connectStream action and a one-time WebSocket token
2. Sinch opens a WebSocket to `/sinch/ws` and sends a `connect` frame — the server verifies the token, replies with `answer`, and bridges audio to Azure Voice Live
3. The AI agent hears the caller, generates a response, and audio (PCM 24kHz) streams back bidirectionally over the same connection

### 🎧 Genesys Cloud AudioHook (Audio Connector)

[Genesys AudioHook](https://developer.genesys.cloud/devapps/audiohook) (Audio Connector) streams real-time call audio from Genesys Cloud to your deployed Container App via WebSocket. Unlike the other telephony options, Genesys does not route phone calls through this template — it forwards audio from calls already handled within Genesys Cloud to your AudioHook endpoint for AI processing.

```
Caller → PSTN → Genesys Cloud → AudioHook WebSocket → Container App → Voice Live AI
```

#### 1. Prerequisites

- A [Genesys Cloud](https://www.genesys.com/genesys-cloud) organization with the Audio Connector feature enabled

> During `azd up`, the setup wizard prompts for a Genesys API key and stores it securely in Azure Key Vault.

| Variable | Description | Where to find it |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `GENESYS_API_KEY` | A shared secret for authenticating AudioHook connections | You define this value — use the same key in both your deployment and Genesys Cloud integration settings |

#### 2. Test with the Browser Simulator (No Genesys Cloud Required)

After deployment, open the simulator page to test without a Genesys Cloud account:

```
https://<your-container-app-url>/genesys
```

The simulator mimics a Genesys AudioHook client in the browser — it sends your microphone audio as PCMU 8kHz and plays back the AI response. Enter the same API key you configured during setup.

#### 3. Connect to Genesys Cloud (Production)

1. Add an AudioHook (Audio Connector) integration in your Genesys Cloud Admin console
2. Set the **Connection URI** to `wss://<your-container-app-url>/audiohook/ws` and the **API Key** to the same value you configured in `GENESYS_API_KEY`
3. Assign the integration to a call flow or queue so that matching calls stream audio to your endpoint

For protocol details, see the [Genesys AudioHook developer documentation](https://developer.genesys.cloud/devapps/audiohook).

**How it works:**
1. Genesys Cloud opens a WebSocket to `/audiohook/ws` and authenticates with the API key
2. The caller's audio streams to the server, which bridges it to Azure Voice Live
3. The AI response audio is streamed back to Genesys Cloud for the caller to hear

### 📞 Telephony with Bandwidth Client (Call Center Scenario)

Inbound calls are handled via [Bandwidth Programmable Voice](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/voice/) — when a call arrives, the server returns [BXML](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/voice/bxml/) that opens a bidirectional media stream, then bridges the caller's audio to Azure Voice Live over a WebSocket.

```
Caller → PSTN → Bandwidth → BXML media stream → Container App → Voice Live AI
```

#### 1. Prerequisites

- A [Bandwidth account](https://www.bandwidth.com/) with **Programmable Voice** enabled
- A phone number in your [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com)
- OAuth 2.0 API credentials — a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

> Bandwidth's legacy API User (username/password Basic Auth) scheme is deprecated. New accounts authenticate with **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials** (Client ID / Client Secret). During `azd up`, the setup wizard prompts for these and stores the secret securely in Azure Key Vault.

| Variable | Description | Where to find it |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `BANDWIDTH_ACCOUNT_ID` | Your numeric Bandwidth Account ID (used in every API path) | [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com) → Account |
| `BANDWIDTH_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth 2.0 Client ID (starts with `CLI-`) | Dashboard → Account → **API Credentials** |
| `BANDWIDTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth 2.0 Client Secret | Dashboard → Account → **API Credentials** (shown once at creation) |

#### 2. Voice Application (Automatic)

The Bandwidth **Voice-V2 Application** and its callback URL are **configured automatically** by the post-deploy script during `azd up`:
- **Call-initiated callback URL:** `https://<your-container-app-url>/bandwidth/incoming` (POST)
- **Callback credentials:** HTTP Basic auth using your Client ID / Client Secret

The script prints the resulting `ApplicationId`, which is also saved to your `azd` environment as `BANDWIDTH_APPLICATION_ID`.

> **Automatic fallback for trial / self-service accounts:** Bandwidth does not allow re-binding a phone number to a different application through the API on these accounts (confirmed by Bandwidth support — it is a platform limitation). On such accounts the number stays bound to the pre-provisioned `default-http-voice` application, whose callback points at a Bandwidth sample endpoint (you'd hear a canned greeting, then the call drops). To work around this, the post-deploy script re-points that Bandwidth-provided default application's callback URL at your container. It only touches Bandwidth-owned sample apps (never your own third-party applications), so inbound calls reach your voice agent without any manual number re-binding.

#### 3. Associate a Number and Enable Inbound Calling (Manual)

On **standard accounts**, Bandwidth binds phone numbers to applications through their own dashboard/API rather than through this template. Point your number at the `voice-agent-accelerator` application (the `ApplicationId` from step 2) following the [Bandwidth documentation](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/voice/). On **trial / self-service accounts** this is handled automatically — see the fallback note above — so you can skip this step.

> **Trial accounts:** Inbound calls may be rejected with SIP `402 Payment Required` even when routing is correct. This is an account **billing/activation** state, not a code or configuration issue — confirm your account is activated for *Inbound Voice*, or contact Bandwidth support.

#### 4. Call the Agent

Dial your Bandwidth phone number. The call connects to the real-time voice agent powered by Azure Voice Live.

**How it works:**
1. Bandwidth sends a call callback to `/bandwidth/incoming` — the server validates the Basic auth credentials and returns BXML that starts a bidirectional media stream
2. Bandwidth opens a WebSocket to `/bandwidth/ws` — the server verifies the embedded token, then bridges audio to Azure Voice Live
3. The caller's audio (PCMU 8kHz) is upsampled to PCM 24kHz for Voice Live; the AI response is streamed back through the same connection

## Local Development

Once the environment has been deployed with `azd up` you can also run the application locally.

Please follow the instructions in [the server README](./server/README.md).

<br/>

## Use Voice Live with Foundry Agents

The Voice Live API supports connecting to an existing **Azure AI Foundry Agent**, allowing you to leverage pre-built capabilities, knowledge bases, and orchestration features alongside real-time voice interactions.

In the `session.update` configuration, you can set different properties such as the model, voice settings, turn detection, and agent connection. For detailed configuration options and step-by-step instructions, refer to the official documentation:

👉 [Get started with Voice Live and Azure AI Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live-agents-quickstart?tabs=windows%2Ckeyless&pivots=ai-foundry-portal)

After updating your configuration, deploy the changes to your Container App:

```bash
azd deploy
```

## Optional Features

### 🎧 Ambient Scenes

Add realistic background audio to your voice agent to simulate real-world call center environments. This feature works for both web browser and phone (ACS) clients.

**Available Presets:**

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `none` | Disabled (default) - clean audio with no background |
| `office` | Quiet office ambient (keyboard typing, soft murmurs) |
| `call_center` | Busy call center background (phones, conversations) |
| *custom* | Add your own audio files (see below) |

**How to Enable:**

1. Set the `AMBIENT_PRESET` environment variable in your `.env` file:
   ```
   AMBIENT_PRESET=call_center
   ```

2. For Azure deployment, set it before running `azd up`:
   ```bash
   azd env set AMBIENT_PRESET call_center
   azd up
   ```

**Adjusting Volume:**

The ambient volume is controlled by `_ambient_gain` in `server/app/handler/ambient_mixer.py`:

```python
self._ambient_gain = 0.08  # Default: subtle background
```

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `0.05` | Very quiet (barely audible) |
| `0.08` | Subtle (default) |
| `0.12` | Moderate |
| `0.20` | Noticeable |

**Using Custom Audio Files:**

You can add your own ambient audio files:

1. Prepare your audio file with these requirements:
   - **Format:** WAV (uncompressed PCM)
   - **Sample Rate:** 24000 Hz
   - **Bit Depth:** 16-bit signed
   - **Channels:** Mono
   - **Duration:** 30-60 seconds (will loop seamlessly)

2. Place the file in `server/app/audio/`

3. Register the preset in `server/app/handler/ambient_mixer.py`:
   ```python
   PRESETS = {
       "none": {"file": None},
       "office": {"file": "office.wav"},
       "call_center": {"file": "callcenter.wav"},
       "my_custom": {"file": "my_audio.wav"},  # Add your preset
   }
   ```

4. Set `AMBIENT_PRESET=my_custom` in your `.env` file

## Troubleshooting

See the [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md) for common deployment issues and solutions, including:
- Docker Hub rate limits during remote builds
- RequestConflict errors from concurrent deployments
- Soft-deleted resource recovery
- Required RBAC permissions

## Debugging Calls

Every log line includes a `cid` — a unique ID generated when a call arrives. Filter by `cid` to see the full lifecycle of one call:

```
2026-06-09 12:00:01 INFO [app.server] [cid=a1b2c3d4e5f6] Incoming Twilio Media Stream WebSocket connection
2026-06-09 12:00:01 INFO [app.twilio] [cid=a1b2c3d4e5f6] Stream started: sid=MZ123, call=CA456
2026-06-09 12:00:02 INFO [app.voicelive] [cid=a1b2c3d4e5f6] Voice Live session connected
2026-06-09 12:00:30 INFO [app.server] [cid=a1b2c3d4e5f6] Call ended normally
```

**Local:** logs print to the terminal where you run the server.

**Deployed:** Azure Portal → Container Apps → your app → Log stream (live), or query `ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL` in Log Analytics for historical search.

Provider-native IDs (Twilio call SID, ACS call connection ID, Genesys conversation ID, Infobip call ID) appear in the log messages. Use them to cross-reference with your provider's dashboard.

## Production Readiness

Before using this accelerator for production traffic, review the [Production Readiness Guide](./docs/production-readiness.md). It covers design changes to consider for scaling, shared state, WebSocket lifecycle, provider-specific reliability, observability, security, privacy, and multi-replica deployments.

## Security Considerations

ACS currently does not support Managed Identity. The ACS connection string is stored securely in Key Vault and injected into the container app via its secret URL.
