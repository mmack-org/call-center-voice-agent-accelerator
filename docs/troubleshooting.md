# Troubleshooting

Common deployment issues and solutions for the Voice Agent Accelerator template.

## Docker Hub Rate Limit During Deployment

If `azd up` or `azd deploy` fails with an error like:

```
toomanyrequests: You have reached your unauthenticated pull rate limit.
```

This happens because the remote Docker build (ACR Tasks) pulls the Python base image from Docker Hub, which rate-limits anonymous pulls to **100 requests per 6 hours** per IP. Azure's shared infrastructure IPs can exhaust this limit during peak usage.

**Option 1: Retry (simplest)**

Wait a few minutes and retry — the limit resets gradually:

```shell
azd deploy
```

**Option 2: Build locally with Docker (recommended if you have Docker installed)**

If Docker Desktop is installed on your machine, you can bypass ACR remote builds entirely:

1. Edit `azure.yaml` and change `remoteBuild` to `false`:
   ```yaml
   docker:
     path: Dockerfile
     remoteBuild: false
   ```

2. Re-deploy:
   ```shell
   azd deploy
   ```

This builds the image locally (using your own Docker Hub pull quota or cached layers) and pushes the built image to ACR.

**Option 3: Authenticate to Docker Hub (avoids anonymous limits)**

If you have a [Docker Hub account](https://hub.docker.com/signup) (free tier gives 200 pulls/6h), log in before deploying:

```shell
docker login
azd deploy
```

With `remoteBuild: false`, local builds authenticate with your Docker Hub credentials automatically.

> **Note:** This issue only affects the first build for a given image tag. Subsequent `azd deploy` runs reuse cached layers and rarely hit the limit.

## RequestConflict During Provisioning

If `azd up` fails with:

```
RequestConflict: Another operation is currently being performed on this resource.
```

This means a previous ARM deployment is still in progress on the same resource group. Common causes:
- Running `azd up` again immediately after a failed or cancelled deployment
- Multiple terminals deploying to the same environment simultaneously

**Fix:** Wait 1–2 minutes for the previous operation to complete, then retry:

```shell
azd up
```

To check for in-progress deployments:

```shell
az deployment group list -g <your-resource-group> --query "[?properties.provisioningState=='Running'].name" -o table
```

## FlagMustBeSetForRestore After `azd down`

If you get this error after tearing down and re-provisioning:

```
FlagMustBeSetForRestore: An existing resource with ID '...' has been soft-deleted.
```

This is already handled — the template sets `restore: true` on AI Services resources. If you still hit it (e.g., after manual portal deletions), purge the soft-deleted resource:

```shell
az cognitiveservices account purge --name <resource-name> --location <location> --resource-group <resource-group>
```

Then retry `azd up`.

## AuthorizationFailed During Provisioning

If you get:

```
AuthorizationFailed: The client does not have authorization to perform action.
```

The template creates resources at **subscription scope** (resource group creation) and assigns RBAC roles. Your account needs:

| Role | Scope | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Contributor** | Subscription | Creates resource group and all resources |
| **Role Based Access Control Administrator** | Subscription | Assigns managed identity roles (Key Vault, AI Services, ACR) |

Check your current roles:

```shell
az role assignment list --assignee $(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv) --query "[].roleDefinitionName" -o table
```

If you only have resource group-level permissions, ask your subscription admin to grant Contributor + RBAC Administrator at subscription scope, or have them pre-create the resource group and grant you Owner on it.

## Realtime Model Deployment Failures

The pre-provision hook rejects a model version or SKU that is absent from the
selected region's current Foundry inventory. Use the command printed in the
error, set `AZURE_VOICE_LIVE_MODEL_NAME`,
`AZURE_VOICE_LIVE_MODEL_VERSION`, and `AZURE_VOICE_LIVE_MODEL_SKU` to an
available combination, and retry.

If ARM reports `InsufficientQuota`, `InvalidResourceProperties`, or a capacity
error for `realtimeDeployment`, request quota, reduce
`AZURE_VOICE_LIVE_MODEL_CAPACITY`, select an available SKU, or choose another
region. See [Foundry project and realtime model](./foundry-project.md) for the
complete configuration and upgrade procedure.

## Foundry IQ Provisioning or Retrieval Failures

Every `azd up` provisions Blob Storage, Azure AI Search, ingestion and agent
model deployments, a knowledge base, and a grounded prompt agent. Common causes
of failure include:

- missing Search, Storage, or Foundry data-plane roles for the deploying
  identity
- RBAC propagation delays immediately after provisioning
- unavailable quota for `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-5.2`, or
  `text-embedding-3-large`
- an empty Blob container or an indexer run that has not completed yet
- an invalid managed-identity project connection or MCP tool configuration

Follow the symptom-based checks in the
[Foundry IQ troubleshooting table](./foundry-iq.md#troubleshooting). To isolate
ingestion from the voice path, first verify the Search index and knowledge base,
then test the prompt agent in the Foundry portal, and finally test the browser
or telephony call.
